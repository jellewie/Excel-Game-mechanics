This is a layout to get game mechanics into Excel,
I've basicly taken the '/Excel-Nabokos' engine en stripped it out. 
Enable the macro's and select S2 to 'play'. 
The layout will restore text + color when you move around, and let you always be Blue cell, It will also stop you from moving into walls.

More info like gamemode options are in the VBA code;

'Gamemode 0 = On first start
'Gamemode 1 = Only buttons
'Gamemode 2 = Buttons, Deny 2 ISteps
'Gamemode 3 = Relative world loading
